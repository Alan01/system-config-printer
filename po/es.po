"The distinguishing technique used in public key cryptography is the use of "
"asymmetric key algorithms, where the key used to encrypt a message is not "
"the same as the key used to decrypt it. Each user has a pair of "
"cryptographic keys — a public key and a private key. The private key is kept "

"private key cannot be feasibly (ie, in actual or projected practice) derived "
