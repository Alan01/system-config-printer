TODO list for system-config-printer
-----------------------------------

* Get UI feedback from a real UI person

* Fix 'use encryption' checkbox in connect dialog

* auth-info-required -- need to show that authentication details can be
  deferred, but let's wait until the smb backend supports it

* Hook into the OpenPrinting API when finding a driver and to provide
  more information about a device or driver

* applet: CUPS-1.4 has CUPS-Get-Document (pycups has getDocument since
  1.9.31) which would allow us to provide thumbnails for jobs

* CUPS-1.4: look at server-is-sharing-printers attribute instead of
  fetching server settings

* should have "Remove Default" for a default printer

* IDN support for UTF-8 hostnames (libidn)

* support for custom paper sizes

* fix SMB browsing: query AD?
