TODO list for system-config-printer
-----------------------------------

* Get UI feedback from a real UI person

* Use GNOME HIG-recommended paddings/layout for widgets

* Make all strings translatable

* All tracebacks should result in a graphical dialog (like anaconda)

* Handle cups.IPP_Error exceptions like:
   cups.IPP_NOT_AUTHORIZED (user doesn't know password and pressed 'cancel')
   cups.IPP_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE (CUPS server shut down)
   etc (other common ones)
  with friendly dialog boxes explaining what happened and what the
  implication is

* Handle unapplied changes:
   - when closing main window
   - when flipping between printers/classes/etc

* 'New connection' should be a modal dialog, not a window
